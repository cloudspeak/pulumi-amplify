# Pulumi Amplify example

This folder contains an example Pulumi program and client application which demonstrates
use of the `pulumi_amplify` package.  It implements a React app which allows users to
create simple notes which are stored in a database.  The notes can only be updated and
deleted by their original creator.

In this example, the Amplify API has already been created using the Amplify CLI, as per
the instructions in `pulumi-amplify`'s README.  The Pulumi program creates the Cognito
User Pool, and deploys the Amplify-generated API.

The project works like this:

* The `src` directory contains the React app
* The `amplify` directory contains a GraphQL schema and AppSync resolvers which were generated by Amplify
* The `__main__.py` file contains a Pulumi program which deploys an `AmplifyGraphQLAPI` resorce using the files in the Amplify directory
  * Every time the Pulumi program deploys, it creates an `aws-exports.js` file in `src` with the relevant parameters for the frontend
